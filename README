Lambda Cache is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license

It is a proof of concept that an API for ehCache could be injected into an existing Java 1.4 code base without the introduction of AOP, AspectJ or other meta-programming technologies. Instead we use simple anonymous-inner-class-as-a-lambda techniques to make a method cacheable with the introduction of 4 lines of code.

(The goal was 2 lines of code but that became difficult to accomplish cleanly.)

An example of the simplest use of cache is shown in the test class SimpleCacheUser and features 4 lines of code for caching wrapping a simple method.

see: src/test/java/com/pssd/cache/SimpleCacheUser.java

Once you can cache using ehCache you now have the possibility of reconfiguring to use Terracotta or other distributed cache technologies.

TODO: allow configuration from XML files in classpath to override configurations embedded in classes.
