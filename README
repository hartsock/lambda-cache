Lambda Cache is a work-for-hire produced for PSS World Medical

It is a proof of concept that an API for ehCache could be injected
into an existing code base without the introduction of AOP, AspectJ
or other meta-programming technologies. Instead we use simple
anonymous inner-class as-a-lambda techniques to make a method
cacheable with the introduction of 4 lines of code.

(The goal was 2 lines of code but this became more cumbersome.)

An example of the simplest use of cache is shown in the test class
SimpleCache and features 4 lines of code for caching wrapping a one
line statement.

see: src/test/java/com/pssd/cache/SimpleCacheUser.java

Once you can cache using ehCache you now have the possibility of
reconfiguring to use Terracotta or other distributed cache technologies.

TODO: allow configuration from XML files in classpath to override
configurations embedded in classes.
